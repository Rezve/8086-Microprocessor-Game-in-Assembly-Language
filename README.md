This is a game developed with assembly language and tested in emu8086 (v4.08) emulator

All you need to copy the code from <code>game.asm</code> file and run it in emu8086.

### Summary
It‚Äôs a balloon shooting game where player shoots an arrow to hit the balloon and when the balloon gets hit it beeps and a new balloon pops up and you get to shoot another arrow towards it. 

I used few label and conditional jump statement to update logic and display everything.
